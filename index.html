    <p class="message">Since our friend from vine launched a coin for the good cause, we decided to take part in it. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="message">

    We started MySpace to connect people and help them express themselves through music and community. 
    Millions of profiles were created, friendships were built, and creativity flourished. 
      I am launching this coin to celebrate the legacy of individuality and connection. 
      In the same spirit as vine we would like to give all the profits to freedom of expression

      Do it for MySpace.
